I studied with these books as above.
1. <이것이 자료구조+알고리즘이다 with C언어>, 한빛미디어, 박상현
2. <윤성우의 열혈 자료구조>, 오렌지미디어, 윤성우

Also I helped from these sites.
1. 윤성우의 프로그래밍 스터디그룹 (https://cafe.naver.com/cstudyjava)

It took tons of time (about 10 or 11 days) but definitely worth it I think. 😊
The main reason this took so much time was because the codes described in those books are heavily well constructed. To say it another way, code size is huge and we should keep track our last studied code to use next chapter.
